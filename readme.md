Java project that emulates a traffic flow simulation.

In order to run the simulation, you have to run the main function of the main.java class in the simulation package and uncomment one of the 4 static methods, the last one being the full simulation.

The simulation is working fine except for the fact that cars don't reach their final destination but stop one crossroad before it instead. I didn't manage to find the bug.

I also didn't implement the roadblock functionality that involved having dynamic paths for the cars.
